To establish a service that has real value to customers, over the course of an extended duration, to develop models that speed up potential solutions to a given problem set (both in theory, and also act upon).
To exploit the potential of a couple of fast-learning students, who are looking for a way to learn not just conventionally, but subjectively (find their way), while also making some money in the process.
Since the team consist of only four persons, the duration, in which the request gets from problem to solution, can be lowered significantly. Also, we are not limited to one specific region of technology, we can adapt fairly quickly to what customers desire. This flexibility is one of the strong suits. 
We imagine ourselves working independently, for/with a contractor that can also be a collaboration between two companies. We would most likely work with technology and proposing potential solutions to problems not as an advisor, but as a contractor. (Making mock-ups, as well as absolving them if it suits)
Opinions on most of the core values has to be mutual, but there can be personal goals as well. There need to be procedures for any scenario what an average company may encounter such as money shortage, personal absence, resignation. In an ideal situation no one would screw over the others, if the company grows, these can be summarized in bylaws, but in the early stages this is not a necessity.
We are happy to conduct any kind of business if in the short term we also gain something beyond money, and in the long run it results in something tangible (actual engineering). There is a limit to the amount of “slave-work” we are willing to do for money.
