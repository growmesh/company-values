-With the help of integrating existing technologies and possibly by researching and developing new solutions, I envision us to motivate young bright minded people to follow in our footsteps and change the world for the better. Like in the field of sustainable sciences, space exploration and responsible AI development.
-In 5 years my vision for the company is to outgrow services and focusing on developing new solutions and products. 
-I hope in 10 years my main focus in sustainable sciences and space can become a reality and my R&D can grow in that direction.
-In 20 years I have no real plans, nor do I wish to thinks this far. I would like to seize this moment, take part, and see in what direction we grow
-Open discussion, safe place to speak up, help each other grow by motivation and help, critical thinking and at a base level refusing hierarchy in technological questions
